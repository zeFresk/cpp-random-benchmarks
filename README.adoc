= Speed comparison & benchmark of differents C++ random number generators (PRNG)

This repository provides an easy way to compare some common pseudo random number generators (PRNGS) used in C++. It also provides my results running the benchmarks for those wanting a quick answer. To reproduce my results and test for yourself, see section <<Test for yourself>>.

WARNING: Most of these algorithms should not be used in a context where security is required.

== Results

All these results were compiled over 100 hundred runs (`--benchmark_repetitions=100`) using an Intel i5-3570 @ 3.40GHz..... The binary was compiled with clang using -O3 -DNDEBUG, without any architecture optimization. The code is written to avoid any clever trick from the compiler that could bias the results.

=== Conclusion

`std::mt19937` and `std::mt19937_64` are the best standard C++ pseudo random number generators in the STL. However, https://www.pcg-random.org/[PCG] is superior in all aspects **for non-cryptographic** uses. https://prng.di.unimi.it/[xoshiro256++] is another very good choice for generating 64 bits random numbers, but it does not support multiple streams like PCG.

`rand()` need to be avoided at all costs, it is very slow and its quality is bad.
